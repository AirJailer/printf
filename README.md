This is a readme file file for printf Group project on ALX between Sunmola Idris and Alaa Ibrahim


Description


This team project is part of the first year curriculum of ALX. _printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

How to use git in a team setting
Applying variadic functions to a big project
The complexities of printf
Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow
Prototype
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

Usage
Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters
Examples
_printf("Hello, main\n") prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line
_printf("%s", "Hello") prints "Hello"
_printf("This is a number: %d", 98) prints "This is a number: 98"
Tasks
These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
Write a function that produces output according to format.
c : converts input into a character
s : converts input into a string
1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
d : converts input into a base 10 integer
i : converts input into an integer
